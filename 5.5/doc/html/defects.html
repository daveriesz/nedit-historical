<H3>Solutions to Common Problems</H3>
</P><P>
For a much more comprehensive list of common problems and solutions, see the
NEdit FAQ.  The latest version of the FAQ can always be found on the NEdit
web site at:
</P><P>
<PRE>
      <A HREF="http://www.nedit.org">http://www.nedit.org</A>.
</PRE>
</P><P>
<B>P: No files are shown in the "Files" list in the Open... dialog.</B>
</P><P>
S: When you use the "Filter" field, include the file specification or a
complete directory specification, including the trailing "/" on Unix.  
(See Help in the Open... dialog).
</P><P>
<B>P: Find Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction as the original Find or Replace.</B>
</P><P>
S: Find Again and Replace Again don't use the direction of the original
search.  The Shift key controls the direction: Ctrl+G means forward,
Shift+Ctrl+G means backward.
</P><P>
<B>P: Preferences specified in the Preferences menu don't seem to get saved when I select Save Defaults.</B>
</P><P>
S: NEdit has two kinds of preferences: 1) per-window preferences, in the
Preferences menu, and 2) default settings for preferences in newly created
windows, in the Default Settings sub-menu of the Preferences menu. 
Per-window preferences are not saved by Save Defaults, only Default
Settings.
</P><P>
<B>P: Columns and indentation don't line up.</B>
</P><P>
S: NEdit is using a proportional width font.  Set the font to a fixed style
(see Preferences menu).
</P><P>
<B>P: NEdit performs poorly on very large files.</B>
</P><P>
S: Turn off Incremental Backup.  With Incremental Backup on, NEdit
periodically writes a full copy of the file to disk.
</P><P>
<B>P: Commands added to the Shell Commands menu (Unix only) don't output anything until they are finished executing.</B>
</P><P>
S: If the command output is directed to a dialog, or the input is from a
selection, output is collected together and held until the command
completes.  De-select both of the options and the output will be shown
incrementally as the command executes.
</P><P>
<B>P: Dialogs don't automatically get keyboard focus when they pop up.</B>
</P><P>
S: Most X Window managers allow you to choose between two categories of
keyboard focus models: pointer focus, and explicit focus.  Pointer focus
means that as you move the mouse around the screen, the window under the
mouse automatically gets the keyboard focus.  NEdit users who use this
focus model should set "Popups Under Pointer" in the Default Settings sub
menu of the preferences menu in NEdit.  Users with the explicit focus
model, in some cases, may have problems with certain dialogs, such as Find
and Replace.  In MWM this is caused by the mwm resource startupKeyFocus
being set to False (generally a bad choice for explicit focus users). 
NCDwm users should use the focus model "click" instead of "explicit",
again, unless you have set it that way to correct specific problems, this
is the appropriate setting for most explicit focus users.
</P><P>
<B>P: The Backspace key doesn't work, or deletes forward rather than backward.</B>
</P><P>
S: While this is an X/Motif binding problem, and should be solved outside of
NEdit in the Motif virtual binding layer (or possibly xmodmap or
translations), NEdit provides an out.  If you set the resource:
nedit.remapDeleteKey to True, NEdit will forcibly map the delete key to
backspace.  The default setting of this resource recently changed, so
users who have been depending on this remapping will now have to set it
explicitly (or fix their bindings).
</P><P>
<B>P: NEdit crashes when I try to paste text in to a text field in a dialog (like Find or Replace) on my SunOS system.</B>
</P><P>
S: On many SunOS systems, you have to set up an nls directory before various
inter-client communication features of Motif will function properly. 
There are instructions in README.sun in /pub/v5_0_2/individual/README.sun on 
ftp.nedit.org, as well as a tar file containing a complete nls 
directory: ftp://ftp.nedit.org/pub/v5_0_2/nls.tar. 
README.sun contains directions for setting up an nls directory, which
is required by Motif for handling copy and paste to Motif text fields.

<H3>Known Defects</H3>
</P><P>
Below is the list of known defects which affect NEdit. The defects your copy
of NEdit will exhibit depend on which system you are running and with which
Motif libraries it was built. Note that there are now Motif 1.2 and/or 2.0
libraries available on ALL supported platforms, and as you can see below
there are far fewer defects in Motif 1.2, so it is in your best interest to
upgrade your system.

<H4>All Versions</H4>
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>DEFECT</B>
</PRE>
Operations between rectangular selections on overlapping lines do nothing.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<I>Work Around</I>
</PRE>
None.  These operations are very complicated and rarely used.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>DEFECT</B>
</PRE>
Cut and Paste menu items fail, or possibly crash, 
for very large (multi-megabyte) selections.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<I>Work Around</I>
</PRE>
Use selection copy (middle mouse button click) 
for transferring larger quantities of data. 
Cut and Paste save the copied text in server 
memory, which is usually limited.

NEdit's version and other system attributes important for diagnosing your
problem.

The NEdit developers subscribe to both discuss@nedit.org and
develop@nedit.org, either of which may be used for reporting defects.  If
you're not sure, or you think the report might be of interest to the general
NEdit user community, send the report to <A HREF="mailto:discuss@nedit.org">discuss@nedit.org</A>.  If it's
something obvious and boring, like we misspelled "anemometer" in the on-line
help, send it to <A HREF="mailto:develop@nedit.org">develop@nedit.org</A>.  If you don't want to subscribe to the
