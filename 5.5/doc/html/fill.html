<H3>Shift Left, Shift Right</H3>
</P><P>
While shifting blocks of text is most important for programmers (See Features
for Programming), it is also useful for other tasks, such as creating
indented paragraphs.
</P><P>
To shift a block of text one tab stop to the right, select the text, then
choose Shift Right from the Edit menu.  Note that the accelerator keys for
these menu items are Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0, which correspond to the right and
left parenthesis on most keyboards.  Remember them as adjusting the text in
the direction pointed to by the parenthesis character.  Holding the Shift key
while selecting either Shift Left or Shift Right will shift the text by one
character.
</P><P>
It is also possible to shift blocks of text by selecting the text
rectangularly, and dragging it left or right (and up or down as well).  Using
a rectangular selection also causes tabs within the selection to be
recalculated and substituted, such that the non-whitespace characters remain
stationary with respect to the selection.

<H3>Filling  </H3>
</P><P>
Text filling using the Fill Paragraph command in the Edit menu is one of the
most important concepts in NEdit.  And it will be well worth your while to
understand how to use it properly.
</P><P>
In plain text files, unlike word-processor files, there is no way to tell
which lines are continuations of other lines, and which lines are meant to be
separate, because there is no distinction in meaning between newline
characters which separate lines in a paragraph, and ones which separate
paragraphs from other text.  This makes it impossible for a text editor like
NEdit to tell parts of the text which belong together as a paragraph from
carefully arranged individual lines.
</P><P>
In continuous wrap mode (Preferences -&#62; Wrap -&#62; Continuous), lines
automatically wrap and unwrap themselves to line up properly at the right
margin.  In this mode, you simply omit the newlines within paragraphs and let
NEdit make the line breaks as needed.  Unfortunately, continuous wrap mode is
not appropriate in the majority of situations, because files with extremely
long lines are not common under Unix and may not be compatible with all
tools, and because you can't achieve effects like indented sections, columns,
or program comments, and still take advantage of the automatic wrapping.
</P><P>
Without continuous wrapping, paragraph filling is not entirely automatic. 
Auto-Newline wrapping keeps paragraphs lined up as you type, but once
entered, NEdit can no longer distinguish newlines which join wrapped text,
and newlines which must be preserved.  Therefore, editing in the middle of a
paragraph will often leave the right margin messy and uneven.
</P><P>
Since NEdit can't act automatically to keep your text lined up, you need to
tell it explicitly where to operate, and that is what Fill Paragraph is for. 
It arranges lines to fill the space between two margins, wrapping the lines
neatly at word boundaries.  Normally, the left margin for filling is inferred
from the text being filled.  The first line of each paragraph is considered
special, and its left indentation is maintained separately from the remaining
lines (for leading indents, bullet points, numbered paragraphs, etc.). 
Otherwise, the left margin is determined by the furthest left non-whitespace
character.  The right margin is either the Wrap Margin, set in the
preferences menu (by default, the right edge of the window), or can also be
chosen on the fly by using a rectangular selection (see below).
</P><P>
There are three ways to use Fill Paragraph.  The simplest is, while you are
typing text, and there is no selection, simply select Fill Paragraph (or type
Ctrl+J), and NEdit will arrange the text in the paragraph adjacent to the
cursor.  A paragraph, in this case, means an area of text delimited by blank
lines.
</P><P>
The second way to use Fill Paragraph is with a selection.  If you select a
range of text and then chose Fill Paragraph, all of the text in the selection
will be filled.  Again, continuous text between blank lines is interpreted as
paragraphs and filled individually, respecting leading indents and blank
lines.
</P><P>
The third, and most versatile, way to use Fill Paragraph is with a
rectangular selection.  Fill Paragraph treats rectangular selections
differently from other commands.  Instead of simply filling the text inside
the rectangular selection, NEdit interprets the right edge of the selection
as the requested wrap margin.  Text to the left of the selection is not
disturbed (the usual interpretation of a rectangular selection), but text to
the right of the selection is included in the operation and is pulled in to
the selected region.  This method enables you to fill text to an arbitrary
right margin, without going back and forth to the wrap-margin dialog, as well
as to exclude text to the left of the selection such as comment bars or other
text columns.
