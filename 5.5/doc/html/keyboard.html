<H2> Keyboard Shortcuts </H2>
<P>
Most of the keyboard shortcuts in NEdit are shown on the right hand sides of
the pull-down menus.  However, there are more which are not as obvious.  These
include; dialog button shortcuts; menu and dialog mnemonics; labeled keyboard
keys, such as the arrows, page-up, page-down, and home; and optional Shift
modifiers on accelerator keys, like [Shift]Ctrl+F.
</P><P>
<H3>Menu Accelerators</H3>
</P><P>
Pressing the key combinations shown on the right of the menu items is a
shortcut for selecting the menu item with the mouse.  Some items have the shift
key enclosed in brackets, such as [Shift]Ctrl+F.  This indicates that the shift
key is optional.  In search commands, including the shift key reverses the
direction of the search.  In Shift commands, it makes the command shift the
selected text by a whole tab stop rather than by single characters.
</P><P>
<H3>Menu Mnemonics</H3>
</P><P>
Pressing the Alt key in combination with one of the underlined characters in
the menu bar pulls down that menu.  Once the menu is pulled down, typing the
underlined characters in a menu item (without the Alt key) activates that
item.  With a menu pulled down, you can also use the arrow keys to select menu
items, and the Space or Enter keys to activate them.
</P><P>
<H3>Keyboard Shortcuts within Dialogs</H3>
</P><P>
One button in a dialog is usually marked with a thick indented outline. 
Pressing the Return or Enter key activates this button.
</P><P>
All dialogs have either a Cancel or Dismiss button.  This button can be
activated by pressing the Escape (or Esc) key.
</P><P>
Pressing the tab key moves the keyboard focus to the next item in a dialog. 
Within an associated group of buttons, the arrow keys move the focus among the
buttons.  Shift+Tab moves backward through the items.
</P><P>
Most items in dialogs have an underline under one character in their name. 
Pressing the Alt key along with this character, activates a button as if you
had pressed it with the mouse, or moves the keyboard focus to the associated
text field or list.
</P><P>
You can select items from a list by using the arrow keys to move the
selection and space to select.
</P><P>
In file selection dialogs, you can type the beginning characters of the file
name or directory in the list to select files
</P><P>
<H3>Labeled Function Keys</H3>
</P><P>
The labeled function keys on standard workstation and PC keyboards, like the
arrows, and page-up and page-down, are active in NEdit, though not shown in the
pull-down menus.
</P><P>
Holding down the control key while pressing a named key extends the scope of
the action that it performs.  For example, Home normally moves the insert
cursor the beginning of a line.  Ctrl+Home moves it to the beginning of the
file. Backspace deletes one character, Ctrl+Backspace deletes one word.
</P><P>
Holding down the shift key while pressing a named key begins or extends a
selection.  Combining the shift and control keys combines their actions.  For
example, to select a word without using the mouse, position the cursor at the
beginning of the word and press Ctrl+Shift+RightArrow.  The Alt key modifies
selection commands to make the selection rectangular.
</P><P>
Under X and Motif, there are several levels of translation between keyboard
keys and the actions they perform in a program.  The "<A HREF="customize.html#Customizing_NEdit">Customizing NEdit</A>", and
"<A HREF="resources.html#X_Resources">X Resources</A>" sections of the Help menu have more information on this subject. 
Because of all of this configurability, and since keyboards and standards for
the meaning of some keys vary from machine to machine, the mappings may be
changed from the defaults listed below.
</P><P>
<H3>Modifier Keys (in general)</H3>
</P><P>
<PRE>
    Ctrl   Extends the scope of the action that the key
           would otherwise perform.  For example, Home
           normally moves the insert cursor to the beginning
           of a line. Ctrl+Home moves it to the beginning of
           the file.  Backspace deletes one character, Ctrl+
           Backspace deletes one word.
</PRE>
</P><P>
<PRE>
    Shift  Extends the selection to the cursor position. If
           there's no selection, begins one between the old
           and new cursor positions.
</PRE>
</P><P>
<PRE>
    Alt    When modifying a selection, makes the selection
           rectangular.
