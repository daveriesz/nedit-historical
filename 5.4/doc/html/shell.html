The Shell menu (Unix versions only) allows you to execute Unix shell commands
from within NEdit.  You can add items to the menu to extend NEdit's command
set or to incorporate custom automatic editing features using shell commands
or editing languages like awk and sed.  To add items to the menu, select
Preferences -&#62; Default Settings Customize Menus -&#62; Shell Menu.  NEdit comes
pre-configured with a few useful Unix commands like spell and sort, but we
encourage you to add your own custom extensions.
</P><P>
Filter Selection... prompts you for a Unix command to use to process the
currently selected text.  The output from this command replaces the contents
of the selection.
</P><P>
Execute Command... prompts you for a Unix command and replaces the current
selection with the output of the command.  If there is no  selection, it
deposits the output at the current insertion point. In the Shell Command
field, the % character expands to the name (including directory path), and
the # character expands to the current line number of the file in the window.
To include a % or # character in the command, use %% or ##, respectively.  
</P><P>
Execute Command Line uses the position of the cursor in the window to
indicate a line to execute as a shell command line.  The cursor may be
positioned anywhere on the line.  This command allows you to use an NEdit
window as an editable command window for saving output and saving commands
for re-execution. Note that the same character expansions described above
in Execute Command also occur with this command.
</P><P>
The X resource called nedit.shell (See "<A HREF="customize.html#Customizing_NEdit">Customizing NEdit</A>") determines which
Unix shell is used to execute commands.  The default value for this resource
is /bin/csh.
