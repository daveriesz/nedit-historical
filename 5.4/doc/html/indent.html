<H2> Auto/Smart Indent </H2>
<P>
Programmers who use structured languages usually require some form of
automatic indent, so that they don't have to continually re-type the
sequences of tabs and/or spaces needed to maintain lengthy running indents. 
NEdit therefore offers "smart" indent, in addition to the traditional
automatic indent which simply lines up the cursor position with the previous
line.

<H3>Smart Indent</H3>
</P><P>
Smart indent macros are only available by default for C and C++, and while
these can easily be configured for different default indentation distances,
they may not conform to everyone's exact C programming style.  Smart indent
is programmed in terms of macros in the NEdit macro language which can be
entered in: Preferences -&#62; Default Settings -&#62; Indent -&#62; Program Smart
Indent.  Hooks are provided for intervening at the point that a newline is
entered, either via the user pressing the Enter key, or through
auto-wrapping; and for arbitrary type-in to act on specific characters typed.
</P><P>
To type a newline character without invoking smart-indent when operating in
smart-indent mode, hold the Shift key while pressing the Return or Enter key.

<H3>Auto-Indent</H3>
</P><P>
With Indent set to Auto (the default), NEdit keeps a running indent.  When
you press the Return or Enter key, spaces and tabs are inserted to line up
the insert point under the start of the previous line.
</P><P>
Regardless of indent-mode, Ctrl+Return always does the automatic indent;
Shift+Return always does a return without indent.

<H3>Block Indentation Adjustment</H3>
</P><P>
The Shift Left and Shift Right commands as well as rectangular dragging can
be used to adjust the indentation for several lines at once.  To shift a
block of text one character to the right, select the text, then choose Shift
Right from the Edit menu.  Note that the accelerator keys for these menu
items are Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0, which correspond to  the right and left
parenthesis on most keyboards.  Remember them as adjusting the text in the
direction pointed to by the parenthesis character.  Holding the Shift key
while selecting either Shift Left or Shift Right will shift the text by one
tab stop (or by one emulated tab stop if tab emulation is turned on).  The
help section "Shifting and Filling" under "Basic Operation" has details.
