<P>
There are several ways to change key bindings in NEdit.  The easiest way to
add a new key binding in NEdit is to define a macro in Preferences -&#62; Default
Settings -&#62; Customize Menus -&#62; Macro Menu.  However, if you want to change
existing bindings or add a significant number of new key bindings you will
need to do so via X resources.
</P><P>
Before reading this section, you must understand how to set X resources (see
the help section "<A HREF="resources.html#X_Resources">X Resources</A>").  Since setting X resources is tricky, it is
also helpful when working on key-binding, to set some easier-to-verify
resource at the same time, as a simple check that the NEdit program is
actually seeing your changes.  The appres program is also very helpful in
checking that the resource settings that you make, actually reach the program
for which they are intended in the correct form.

<H3>Key Binding in General</H3>
</P><P>
Keyboard commands are associated with editor action routines through two
separate mechanisms in NEdit.  Commands which appear in pull-down menus have
individual resources designating a keyboard equivalent to the menu command,
called an accelerator key.  Commands which do not have an associated menu
item are bound to keys via the X toolkit translation mechanism.  The methods
for changing these two kinds of bindings are quite different.

<H3>Key Binding Via Translations</H3>
</P><P>
The most general way to bind actions to keys in NEdit is to use the
translation table associated with the text widget.  To add a binding to Alt+Y
to insert the string "Hi!", for example, add lines similar to the following
to your X resource file:
</P><P>
<PRE>
    NEdit*text.Translations: #override \n\
      Alt&#60;Key&#62;y: insert_string("Hi!") \n
</PRE>
</P><P>
The Help topic "<A HREF="actions.html#Action_Routines">Action Routines</A>" lists the actions available to be bound.
</P><P>
Translation tables map key and mouse presses, window operations, and other
kinds of events, to actions. The syntax for translation tables is
simplified here, so you may need to refer to a book on the X window system
for more detailed information.
</P><P>
Note that accelerator resources (discussed below) override translations, and
that most Ctrl+letter and Alt+letter combinations are already bound to an
accelerator key.  To use one of these combinations from a translation table,
therefore, you must first un-bind the original menu accelerator.
</P><P>
A resource for changing a translation table consists of a keyword; #override,
#augment, or #replace; followed by lines (separated by newline characters)
pairing events with actions.  Events begin with modifiers, like Ctrl, Shift,
or Alt, followed by the event type in &#60;&#62;.  BtnDown, Btn1Down, Btn2Down,
Btn1Up, Key, KeyUp are valid event types.  For key presses, the event type is
followed by the name of the key.  You can specify a combination of events,
such as a sequence of key presses, by separating them with commas.  The other
half of the event/action pair is a set of actions.  These are separated from
the event specification by a colon and from each other by spaces.  Actions
are names followed by parentheses, optionally containing one or more
parameters separated by comas.

<H3>Changing Menu Accelerator Keys</H3>
</P><P>
The menu shortcut keys shown at the right of NEdit menu items can also be
changed via X resources.  Each menu item has two resources associated with
it, accelerator, the event to trigger the menu item; and acceleratorText, the
string shown in the menu.  The form of the accelerator resource is the same
as events for translation table entries discussed above, though multiple keys
and other subtleties are not allowed.  The resource name for a menu is the
title in lower case, followed by "Menu", the resource name of menu item is
the name in lower case, run together, with words separated by caps, and all
punctuation removed.  For example, to change Cut to Ctrl+X, you would add the
following to your .Xdefaults file:
</P><P>
<PRE>
      nedit*editMenu.cut.accelerator: Ctrl&#60;Key&#62;x
      nedit*editMenu.cut.acceleratorText: Ctrl+X
</PRE>
</P><P>
Accelerator keys with optional shift key modifiers, like Find..., have an
additional accelerator resource with Shift appended to the name.  For
example:
</P><P>
<PRE>
      nedit*searchMenu.find.acceleratorText: [Shift]Alt+F
      nedit*searchMenu.find.accelerator: Alt&#60;Key&#62;f
      nedit*searchMenu.findShift.accelerator: Shift Alt&#60;Key&#62;f
</PRE>
