NEdit has two general types of selections, primary (highlighted text), and
secondary (underlined text). Selections can cover either a simple range of
text between two points in the file, or they can cover a rectangular area of
the file. Rectangular selections are only useful with non-proportional (fixed
spacing) fonts.
</P><P>
To select text for copying, deleting, or replacing, press the left mouse
button with the pointer at one end of the text you want to select, and drag
it to the other end. The text will become highlighted. To select a whole
word, double click (click twice quickly in succession). Double clicking and
then dragging the mouse will select a number of words. Similarly, you can
select a whole line or a number of lines by triple clicking or triple
clicking and dragging. Quadruple clicking selects the whole file. After
releasing the mouse button, you can still adjust a selection by holding down
the shift key and dragging on either end of the selection. To delete the
selected text, press delete or backspace. To replace it, begin typing.

To select a rectangle or column of text, hold the Ctrl key while dragging the
mouse. Rectangular selections can be used in any context that normal
selections can be used, including cutting and pasting, filling, shifting,
dragging, and searching. Operations on rectangular selections automatically
fill in tabs and spaces to maintain alignment of text within and to the right
of the selection. Note that the interpretation of rectangular selections by
Fill Paragraph is slightly different from that of other commands, the section
titled "<A HREF="fill.html#Shifting_and_Filling">Shifting and Filling</A>" has details.

The middle mouse button can be used to make an additional selection (called
the secondary selection). As soon as the button is released, the contents of
this selection will be copied to the insert position of the window where the
mouse was last clicked (the destination window). This position is marked by a
caret shaped cursor when the mouse is outside of the destination window.  If
there is a (primary) selection, adjacent to the cursor in the window, the new
text will replace the selected text. Holding the shift key while making the
secondary selection will move the text, deleting it at the site of the
secondary selection, rather than copying it.
</P><P>
Selected text can also be dragged to a new location in the file using the
middle mouse button. Holding the shift key while dragging the text will copy
the selected text, leaving the original text in place. Holding the control
key will drag the text in overlay mode.
</P><P>
Normally, dragging moves text by removing it from the selected position at
the start of the drag, and inserting it at a new position relative to to the
mouse. Dragging a block of text over existing characters, displaces the
characters to the end of the selection. In overlay mode, characters which are
occluded by blocks of text being dragged are simply removed. When dragging
non-rectangular selections, overlay mode also converts the selection to
rectangular form, allowing it to be dragged outside of the bounds of the
existing text.

The section "<A HREF="mouse.html#Using_the_Mouse">Using the Mouse</A>" sumarizes the mouse commands for making primary
and secondary selections. Primary selections can also be made via keyboard
commands, see "<A HREF="keyboard.html#Keyboard_Shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</A>".
