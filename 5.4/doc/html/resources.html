<H2> X Resources </H2>
<P>
NEdit has additional options to those provided in the Preferences menu which
are set using X resources.  Like most other X programs, NEdit can be
customized to vastly unnecessary proportions, from initial window positions
down to the font and shadow colors of each individual button (A complete
discussion of how to do this is left to books on the X Window System).  Key
binding (see "<A HREF="binding.html#Key_Binding">Key Binding</A>" is one of the most useful of these resource
settable options.
</P><P>
X resources are usually specified in a file called .Xdefaults or .Xresources
in your home directory (on VMS this is sys$login:decw$xdefaults.dat).  On
some systems, this file is read and its information attached to the X server
(your screen) when you start X.  On other systems, the .Xdefaults file is
read each time you run an X program.  When X resource values are attached to
the X server, changes to the resource file are not available to application
programs until you either run the xrdb program with the appropriate file as
input, or re-start the X server.
</P><P>
<H3>Selected X Resource Names</H3>
</P><P>
The following are selected NEdit resource names and default values for NEdit
options not settable via the Preferences menu (for preference resource names,
see your NEdit preference file):
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.tagFile</B>: (not defined) 
</PRE>
</P><P>
This can be the name of a file, or multiple files separated by a colon (:)
character, of the type produced by Exuberant Ctags or the Unix ctags
command, which NEdit will load at startup time (see <A HREF="#ctags">ctag support</A> ). The tag
file provides a database from which NEdit can automatically open files
containing the definition of a particular subroutine or data type.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.alwaysCheckRelativeTagsSpecs: True</B>
</PRE>
</P><P>
When this resource is set to True, and there are tag files specified (with
the nedit.tagFile resource, see above) as relative paths, NEdit will evaluate
these tag value paths whenever a file is opened. All accessible tag files
will be loaded at this time. When this resource value is False, relative path
tag specifications will only be evaluated at NEdit startup time.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.shell</B>: /bin/csh 
</PRE>
</P><P>
(Unix systems only) The Unix shell (command interpreter) to use for executing
commands from the Shell menu
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.wordDelimiters</B>: .,/\\`'!@#%^&#38;*()-=+{}[]":;&#60;&#62;?
</PRE>
</P><P>
The characters, in addition to blanks and tabs, which mark the boundaries
between words for the move-by-word (Ctrl+Arrow) and select-word (double
click) commands.  Note that this default value may be overridden by the
setting in Preferences -&#62; Default Settings -&#62; Language Modes....
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.remapDeleteKey</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
Setting this resource to True forcibly maps the delete key to backspace. This
can be helpful on systems where the bindings have become tangled, and in
environments which mix systems with PC style keyboards and systems with DEC
and Macintosh keyboards.  Theoretically, these bindings should be made using
the standard X/Motif mechanisms, outside of NEdit.  In practice, some
environments where users access several different systems remotely, can be
very hard to configure. If you've given up and are using a backspace key
halfway off the keyboard because you can't figure out the bindings, set this
to True.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.typingHidesPointer</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
Setting this resource to True causes the mouse pointer to be hidden when you
type in the text area. As soon as the mouse pointer is moved, it will 
reappear.  This is useful to stop the mouse pointer from obscuring text.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.overrideDefaultVirtualKeyBindings</B>: Auto
</PRE>
</P><P>
Motif uses a virtual key binding mechanism that shares the bindings between
different Motif applications. When a first Motif application is started, it
installs some default virtual key bindings and any other Motif application 
that runs afterwards, simply reuses them. Obviously, if the first
application installs an invalid set, all others applications may have 
problems.
</P><P>
In the past, NEdit has been the victim of invalid bindings installed by other 
applications several times. Through this resource, NEdit can be instructed
to ignore the bindings installed by other applications, and use its own
private bindings. By default, NEdit tries to detect invalid bindings
and ignore them automatically (Auto). Optionally, NEdit can be told to
always keep the installed bindings (Never), or to always override them
(Always).
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.stdOpenDialog</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
Setting this resource to True restores the standard Motif style of Open
dialog.  NEdit file open dialogs are missing a text field at the bottom of
the dialog, where the file name can be entered as a string.  The field is
removed in NEdit to encourage users to type file names in the list, a
non-standard, but much faster method for finding files.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.bgMenuButton</B>: ~Shift~Ctrl~Meta~Alt&#60;Btn3Down&#62;
</PRE>
</P><P>
Specification for mouse button / key combination to post the background menu
(in the form of an X translation table event specification).  The event
specification should be as specific as possible, since it will override less
specific translation table entries.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.maxPrevOpenFiles</B>: 30
</PRE>
</P><P>
Number of files listed in the Open Previous sub-menu of the File menu.
Setting this to zero disables the Open Previous menu item and maintenance of
the NEdit file history file.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printCommand</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
Command used by the print dialog to print a file, such as, lp, lpr, etc..
The command must be capable of accepting input via stdin (standard input).
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printCopiesOption</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
Option name used to specify multiple copies to the print command.  If the
option should be separated from its argument by a space, leave a trailing
space. If blank, no "Number of Copies" item will appear in the print dialog.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printQueueOption</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
Option name used to specify a print queue to the print command.  If the
option should be separated from its argument by a space, leave a trailing
space. If blank, no "Queue" item will appear in the print dialog.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printNameOption</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
Option name used to specify a job name to the print command.  If the option
should be separated from its argument by a space, leave a trailing space. If
blank, no job or file name will be attached to the print job or banner page.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printHostOption</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
Option name used to specify a host name to the print command.  If the option
should be separated from its argument by a space, leave a trailing space. If
blank, no "Host" item will appear in the print dialog.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printDefaultQueue</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
The name of the default print queue.  Used only to display in the print
dialog, and has no effect on printing.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.visualID</B>: Best
</PRE>
</P><P>
If your screen supports multiple visuals (color mapping models), this
resource allows you to manually choose among them.  The default value of
"Best" chooses the deepest (most colors) visual available. Since NEdit does
not depend on the specific characteristics of any given color model, Best
probably IS the best choice for everyone, and the only reason for setting
this resource would be to patch around some kind of X server problem. The
resource may also be set to "Default", which chooses the screen's default
visual (often a color-mapped, PseudoColor, visual for compatibility with
older X applications).  It may also be set to a numeric visual-id value (use
xdpyinfo to see the list of visuals supported by your display), or a visual
class name: PseudoColor, DirectColor, TrueColor, etc..
</P><P>
If you are running under a themed environment (like KDE or CDE) that places
its colors in a shallow visual, and you'd rather have that color scheme
instead of more colors available, then you may need set the visual to
"Default" so that NEdit doesn't choose one with more colors.  (The reason
for this is: if the "best" visual is not the server's default, then NEdit
cannot use the colors provided by your environment.  NEdit will fall back to
its own default color scheme.)
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.installColormap</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
Force the installation of a private colormap.  If you have a humble 8-bit
color display, and netscape is hogging all of the color cells, you may want
to try turning this on.  On most systems, this will result in colors flashing
wildly when you switch between NEdit and other applications.  But a few
systems (SGI) have hardware support for multiple simultaneous colormaps, and
applications with installed colormaps are well behaved.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.findReplaceUsesSelection</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
Controls if the Find and Replace dialogs are automatically loaded with the
contents of the primary selection.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.stickyCaseSenseButton</B>: True
</PRE>
</P><P>
Controls if the "Case Sensitive" buttons in the Find and Replace dialogs and
the incremental search bar maintain a separate state for literal and regular
expression searches. Moreover, when set to True, by default literal searches
are case insensitive and regular expression searches are case sensitive. When
set to False, the "Case Sensitive" buttons are independent of the "Regular
Expression" toggle.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit.printDefaultHost</B>: (system specific)
</PRE>
</P><P>
The node name of the default print host.  Used only to display in the print
dialog, and has no effect on printing.

text fields in the program. Other choices are: BOTTOM_RIGHT, TOP_LEFT, or
TOP_RIGHT.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit*text.autoWrapPastedText</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>

normally only applies to typed text) to pasted text as well.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit*text.heavyCursor</B>: False
</PRE>
</P><P>
For monitors with poor resolution or users who have difficulty seeing the
cursor, makes the cursor in the text editing area of the window heavier and
darker.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit*text.cursorVPadding</B>: 0
</PRE>
</P><P>
Number of lines to keep the cursor away from the top or bottom line of the 
window.  Keyboard operations that would cause the cursor to get closer than
this distance cause the window to scroll up or down instead, except at the 
beginning of the file.  Mouse operations are not affected.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>nedit*text.blinkRate</B>: 500
</PRE>
</P><P>
Blink rate of the text insertion cursor in milliseconds.  Set to zero to stop
