<P>
There are two separate mailing lists for nedit users, and one for developers.
Users may post to the developer mailing list to report defects and communicate
with the nedit developers.  Remember that nedit is entirely a volunteer
effort, so please ask questions first to the discussion list, and do your
share to answer other users questions as well.
