<H2> Range Sets </H2>
<P>
The user can create range sets, identified by opaque integers.  A range set
contains ranges, defined by start and end positions in the text buffer.
These ranges are adjusted when modifications are made to the text buffer:
they shuffle around when characters are added or deleted.  However, ranges
within a set will coalesce if the characters between them are removed, or
a new range is added to the set which bridges or overlaps others.
</P><P>
Using range sets allows non-contiguous bits of the text to be identified as a
group.
</P><P>
Range sets can be assigned a background color: characters within a range of a
range set will have the background color of the range set. If more than one
rangeset includes a given character, its background color will be that of the
most recently created range set which has a color defined.
</P><P>
Range sets must be created using the rangeset_create() function, which 
will return an identifier for the newly-created rangeset.  This identifier
is then passed to the other rangeset functions to manipulate the range set.
</P><P>
There is a limit to the number of range sets which can exist at any time -
up to 63 in each text buffer.  Care should be taken to destroy any rangesets
which are no longer needed, by using the rangeset_destroy() function.
</P><P>
Warnings: A range set is manipulated ONLY through macro routines. Range sets
can easily become very large, and may exceed the capacity of the running
process.  Coloring relies on proper color names or specifications (such as
the "#rrggbb" hexadecimal digit strings), and appropriate hardware support. 
Behaviours set using rangeset_set_mode() are still experimental.

<H3>Range set functions</H3>
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_create()</B>
<B>rangeset_create( n )</B>
</PRE>
Creates one or more new range sets. The first form creates a single range
set and returns its identifier; if there are no range sets available it 
returns 0. The second form creates n new range sets, and returns an array 
of the range set identifiers with keys beginning at 0. If the requested 
number of range sets is not available it returns an empty array.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_destroy( r )</B>
<B>rangeset_destroy( array )</B>
</PRE>
Deletes all information about a range set or a number of range sets. The
first form destroys the range set identified by r. The second form should 
be passed an array of rangeset identifiers with keys beginning at 0 (i.e.
the same form of array returned by rangeset_create(n); it destroys all the
range sets appearing in the array. If any of the range sets do not exist,
the function continues without errors. Does not return a value.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_add( r, [start, end] )</B>
<B>rangeset_add( r, r0 )</B>
</PRE>
Adds to the range set r. The first form adds the range identified by the
current primary selection to the range set, unless start and end are defined,
in which case the range they define is added. The second form adds all
ranges in the range set r0 to the range set r. Returns the index of the 
newly-added range within the rangeset.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_subtract( r, [start, end] )</B>
<B>rangeset_subtract( r, r0 )</B>
</PRE>
Removes from the range set r. The first form removes the range identified by
the current primary selection from the range set, unless start and end are
defined, in which case the range they define is removed. The second form
removes all ranges in the range set r0 from the range set r. Does not return
a value.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_invert( r )</B>
</PRE>
Changes the range set r so that it contains all ranges not in r. Does not
return a value.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_get_by_name( name )</B>
</PRE>
Returns an array of active rangeset identifiers, with integer keys starting at 0,
whose name matches name.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_info( r )</B>
</PRE>
Returns an array containing information about the range set r. The array
has the following keys: <B>defined</B> (whether a range set with identifier
r is defined), <B>count</B> (the number of ranges in the range set), <B>color</B>
(the current background color of the range set, an empty string if the
range set has no color), <B>name</B> (the user supplied name of the range set,
an empty string if the range set has no name), and <B>mode</B> (the name of the
modify-response mode of the range set).
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_range( r, [index] )</B>
</PRE>
Returns details of a specific range in the range set r.  The range is 
specified by index, which should be between 1 and n (inclusive), where
n is the number of ranges in the range set.  The return value is an array
containing the keys <B>start</B> (the start position of the range) and <B>end</B>
(the end position of the range).  If index is not supplied, the region
returned is the span of the entire range set (the region starting at the 
start of the first range and ending at the end of the last).  If index
is outside the correct range of values, the function returns an empty array.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_includes( r, pos )</B>
</PRE>
Returns the index of the range in range set r which includes pos; returns
0 if pos is not contained in any of the ranges of r.  This can also be used
as a simple true/false function which returns true if pos is contained in
the range set.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_set_color( r, color )</B>
</PRE>
Attempts to apply the color as a background color to the ranges of r. If
color is at empty string, removes the coloring of r.  No check is made 
regarding the validity of color: if the color is invalid (a bad name,
or not supported by the hardware) this has unpredictable effects.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_set_name( r, name )</B>
</PRE>
Apply the name to the range set r.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>rangeset_set_mode( r, type )</B>
</PRE>
Changes the behaviour of the range set r when modifications to the text
buffer occur.  type can be one of the following: "maintain" (the default),
"break", "include", "exclude", "ins_del" or "del_ins". (The differences are
fairly subtle.)
