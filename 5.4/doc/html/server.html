<H2> Client/Server Mode </H2>
<P>
NEdit can be operated on its own, or as a two-part client/server
application.  Client/server mode is useful for integrating NEdit with
software development environments, mailers, and other programs; or just as a
quick way to open files from the shell command line without starting a new
NEdit session.
</P><P>
To run NEdit in server mode, type:
</P><P>
<PRE>
      nedit -server
</PRE>
</P><P>
NEdit can also be started in server mode via the NEdit Client program
(<B>nc</B>) when no servers are available.
</P><P>
The nc program, which is distributed along with NEdit, sends commands to
an NEdit server to open files or execute editor actions. It can also be
used on files that are already opened.
</P><P>
Listing a file on the nc command line means: Open it if it is not already
open and bring the window to the front.
</P><P>
nc supports the following command line options:
</P><P>
<PRE>
    <B>nc</B> [<B>-read</B>] [<B>-create</B>]
       [<B>-line</B> n | <B>+</B>n] [<B>-do</B> command] [<B>-lm</B> languagemode]
       [<B>-svrname</B> name] [<B>-svrcmd</B> command]
       [<B>-ask</B>] [<B>-noask</B>] [<B>-timeout</B> seconds]
       [<B>-geometry</B> geometry | <B>-g</B> geometry] [<B>-icon</B> | <B>-iconic</B>]
       [<B>-wait</B>]
       [<B>-V</B> | <B>-version</B>]
       [<B>-xrm</B> resourcestring] [<B>-display</B> [host]:server[.screen]]
       [<B>-</B>-] [file...]
</PRE>
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-read</B>
</PRE>
Open the file read-only regardless of its actual permissions. There is no
effect if the file is already open.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-create</B>
</PRE>
Don't warn about file creation when a file doesn't exist.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-line</B> n, <B>+</B>n
</PRE>
Go to line number n. This will also affect files which are already open.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-do</B> command
</PRE>
Execute an NEdit macro or action on the file following the -do argument
on the command line. Note that other files mentioned in the command line
are not affected.
</P><P>
If you use this command without a filename, nc would randomly choose one
window to focus and execute the macro in.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-ask</B>, <B>-noask</B>
</PRE>
Instructs nc to automatically start a server if one is not available.  This
overrides the X resource `nc.autoStart' (see <A HREF="resources.html#X_Resources">X Resources</A>).
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-svrname</B> name
</PRE>
Explicitly instructs nc which server to connect to, an instance of
nedit(1) with a corresponding -svrname argument.  By naming servers, you
can run several simultaneously, and direct files and commands
specifically to any one. 
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-svrcmd</B> command
</PRE>
The command which nc uses to start an NEdit server. It is also settable
via the X resource `nc.serverCommand' (see <A HREF="resources.html#X_Resources">X Resources</A>). Defaults to
"nedit -server".
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-lm</B> languagemode
</PRE>
Initial language mode used.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-geometry</B> geometry, <B>-g</B> geometry
</PRE>
The initial size and/or location of editor windows. See
<A HREF="command_line.html#NEdit_Command_Line">NEdit Command Line</A> for details.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-icon</B>, <B>-iconic</B>
</PRE>
Initial window state.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-display</B> [&#60;host&#62;]:&#60;server&#62;[.&#60;screen&#62;]
</PRE>
The name of the X server to use. See <A HREF="command_line.html#NEdit_Command_Line">NEdit Command Line</A> for details.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-timeout</B> seconds
</PRE>
Basic time-out period used in communication with an NEdit server.  The
default is 10 seconds. Also settable via the X resource `nc.timeOut'.
</P><P>
Under rare conditions (such as a slow connection), it may be necessary to
increase the time-out period. In most cases, the default is fine.
</P><P>
<PRE>
<B>-wait</B>
</PRE>
Instructs nc not to return to the shell until all files given are closed.
</P><P>
Normally, nc returns once the files given in its command line are opened
by the server. When this option is given, nc returns only after the last
file given in this call is closed.
</P><P>
Note that this option affects all files in the command line, not only the
ones following this option.
</P><P>
Note that nc will wait for all files given in the command line, even if
the files were already opened.
</P><P>
<H4>Command Line Arguments</H4>
</P><P>
In typical Unix style, arguments affect the files which follow them on the
command line, for example:
</P><P>
<PRE>
      incorrect:   nc file.c -line 25
      correct:     nc -line 25 file.c
</PRE>
</P><P>
-read, -create, and -line affect all of the files which follow them on the
command line.
</P><P>
The -do macro is executed only once, on the next file on the line.  -do
without a file following it on the command line, executes the macro on the
first available window (presumably when you give a -do command without a
corresponding file or window, you intend it to do something independent of
the window in which it happens to execute).
</P><P>
The -wait option affects all files named in the command line.
</P><P>
<H4>Multiple Servers</H4>
</P><P>
Sometimes it is useful to have more than one NEdit server running, for
example to keep mail and programming work separate.  The option, -svrname, to
both nedit and nc, allows you to start, and communicate with, separate named
servers.  A named server responds only to requests with the corresponding
-svrname argument.  If you use ClearCase and are within a ClearCase view, the
server name will default to the name of the view (based on the value of the
CLEARCASE_ROOT environment variable).
</P><P>
<H4>Communication</H4>
</P><P>
Communication between nc and nedit is done through the X display. So as long
as the X Window System is set up and working properly, nc will work properly
as well. nc uses the DISPLAY environment variable, the machine name and your
user name to find the appropriate server, meaning, if you have several
machines sharing a common file system, nc will not be able to find a server
that is running on a machine with a different host name, even though it may
be perfectly appropriate for editing a given file.
</P><P>
The command which nc uses to start an nedit server is settable via the X
resource nc.serverCommand, by default, "nedit -server".
