<H2> Finding and Replacing Text </H2>
<P>
The Search menu contains a number of commands for finding and replacing text.
</P><P>
The Find... and Replace... commands present dialogs for entering text for
searching and replacing.  These dialogs also allow you to choose whether you
want the search to be sensitive to upper and lower case, or whether to use
the standard Unix pattern matching characters (regular expressions). 
Searches begin at the current text insertion position.
</P><P>
Find Again and Replace Again repeat the last find or replace command without
prompting for search strings.  To selectively replace text, use the two
commands in combination: Find Again, then Replace Again if the highlighted
string should be replaced, or Find Again again to go to the next string.
</P><P>
Find Selection searches for the text contained in the current primary
selection (see <A HREF="select.html#Selecting_Text">Selecting Text</A>).  The selected text does not have to be in the
current editor window, it may even be in another program.  For example, if
the word dog appears somewhere in a window on your screen, and you want to
find it in the file you are editing, select the word dog by dragging the
mouse across it, switch to your NEdit window and choose Find Selection from
the Search menu.
</P><P>
Find Incremental is yet another variation on searching, where every character
typed triggers a new search.  Incremental searching is generally the quickest
way to find something in a file, because it gives you the immediate feedback
of seeing how your search is progressing, so you never need to type more than
the minimally sufficient search string to reach your target.
</P><P>
<H3>Searching Backwards</H3>
</P><P>
Holding down the shift key while choosing any of the search or replace
commands from the menu (or using the keyboard shortcut), will search in the
reverse direction.  Users who have set the search direction using the buttons
in the search dialog, may find it a bit confusing that Find Again and Replace
Again don't continue in the same direction as the original search (for
experienced users, consistency of the direction implied by the shift key is
more important).
</P><P>
<H3>Selective Replacement</H3>
</P><P>
To replace only some occurrences of a string within a file, choose Replace...
from the Search menu, enter the string to search for and the string to
substitute, and finish by pressing the Find button.  When the first
occurrence is highlighted, use either Replace Again (^T) to replace it, or
Find Again (^G) to move to the next occurrence without replacing it, and
continue in such a manner through all occurrences of interest.
</P><P>
To replace all occurrences of a string within some range of text, select the
range (see <A HREF="select.html#Selecting_Text">Selecting Text</A>), choose Replace... from the Search menu, type the
string to search for and the string to substitute, and press the "R. in
Selection" button in the dialog.  Note that selecting text in the Replace...
dialog will unselect the text in the window.
