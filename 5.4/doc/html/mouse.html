<H2> Using the Mouse </H2>
<P>
Mouse-based editing is what NEdit is all about, and learning to use the more
advanced features like secondary selections and primary selection dragging
will be well worth your while.
</P><P>
If you don't have time to learn everything, you can get by adequately with
just the left mouse button:  Clicking the left button moves the cursor. 
Dragging with the left button makes a selection.  Holding the shift key while
clicking extends the existing selection, or begins a selection between the
cursor and the mouse.  Double or triple clicking selects a whole word or a
whole line.
</P><P>
This section will make more sense if you also read the section called,
"<A HREF="select.html#Selecting_Text">Selecting Text</A>", which explains the terminology of selections, that is,
what is meant by primary, secondary, rectangular, etc.

Overlay Mode: Normally, dragging moves text by removing it from the selected
position at the start of the drag, and inserting it at a new position
relative to to the mouse. When you drag a block of text over existing
characters, the existing characters are displaced to the end of the
selection.  In overlay mode, characters which are occluded by blocks of text
being dragged are simply removed.  When dragging non-rectangular selections,
overlay mode also converts the selection to rectangular form, allowing it to
be dragged outside of the bounds of the existing text.
</P><P>
Mouse buttons 4 and 5 are usually represented by a mouse wheel nowadays. 
They are used to scroll up or down in the text window.
</P><P>
* The Alt key may be labeled Meta or Compose-Character on some keyboards. 
Some window managers, including default configurations of mwm, bind
combinations of the Alt key and mouse buttons to window manager operations. 
In NEdit, Alt is only used on button release, so regardless of the window
manager bindings for Alt-modified mouse buttons, you can still do the
corresponding NEdit operation by using the Alt key AFTER the initial mouse
press, so that Alt is held while you release the mouse button.  If you find
this difficult or annoying, you can re-configure most window managers to skip
this binding, or you can re-configure NEdit to use a different key
combination.
