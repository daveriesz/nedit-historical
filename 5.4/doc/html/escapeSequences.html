<H3>Escaping Metacharacters</H3>
</P><P>
In a regular expression (regex), most ordinary characters match themselves.  
For example, `ab%' would match anywhere `a' followed by `b' followed by `%'
appeared in the text.  Other characters don't match themselves, but are
metacharacters. For example, backslash is a special metacharacter which
'escapes' or changes the meaning of the character following it. Thus, to
match a literal backslash would require a regular expression to have two
backslashes in sequence. NEdit provides the following escape sequences so
that metacharacters that are used by the regex syntax can be specified as
ordinary characters.
</P><P>
<PRE>
     \(  \)  \-  \[  \]  \&#60;  \&#62;  \{  \}
     \.  \|  \^  \$  \*  \+  \?  \&#38;  \\
</PRE>
</P><P>
<H3>Special Control Characters</H3>
</P><P>
There are some special characters that are  difficult or impossible to type. 
Many of these characters can be constructed as a sort of metacharacter or
sequence by preceding a literal character with a backslash. NEdit recognizes
the following special character sequences:
</P><P>
<PRE>
     \a  alert (bell)
     \b  backspace
     \e  ASCII escape character (***)
     \f  form feed (new page)
     \n  newline
     \r  carriage return
     \t  horizontal tab
     \v  vertical tab
</PRE>
</P><P>
<PRE>
     *** For environments that use the EBCDIC character set,
         when compiling NEdit set the EBCDIC_CHARSET compiler
         symbol to get the EBCDIC equivalent escape
         character.)
</PRE>
</P><P>
<H3>Octal and Hex Escape Sequences</H3>
</P><P>
Any ASCII (or EBCDIC) character, except null, can be specified by using
either an octal escape or a hexadecimal escape, each beginning with \0 or \x
(or \X), respectively.  For example, \052 and \X2A both specify the `*'
character.  Escapes for null (\00 or \x0) are not valid and will generate an
error message.  Also, any escape that exceeds \0377 or \xFF will either cause
an error or have any additional character(s) interpreted literally. For
example, \0777 will be interpreted as \077 (a `?' character) followed by `7'
since \0777 is greater than \0377.
</P><P>
An invalid digit will also end an octal or hexadecimal escape.  For example,
\091 will cause an error since `9' is not within an octal escape's range of
allowable digits (0-7) and truncation before the `9' yields \0 which is
invalid.
</P><P>
<H3>Shortcut Escape Sequences</H3>
</P><P>
NEdit defines some escape sequences that are handy shortcuts for commonly
used character classes.
</P><P>
<PRE>
   \d  digits            0-9
   \l  letters           a-z, A-Z, and locale dependent letters
   \s  whitespace        \t, \r, \v, \f, and space
   \w  word characters   letters, digits, and underscore, `_'
</PRE>
</P><P>
\D, \L, \S, and \W are the same as the lowercase versions except that the
resulting character class is negated.  For example, \d is equivalent to
`[0-9]', while \D is equivalent to `[^0-9]'.
</P><P>
These escape sequences can also be used within a character class.  For
example, `[\l_]' is the same as `[a-zA-Z_]', extended with possible locale 
dependent letters. The escape sequences for special characters, and octal
and hexadecimal escapes are also valid within a class.
</P><P>
<H3>Word Delimiter Tokens</H3>
</P><P>
Although not strictly a character class, the following escape sequences
behave similarly to character classes:
</P><P>
<PRE>
     \y   Word delimiter character
     \Y   Not a word delimiter character
</PRE>
</P><P>
The `\y' token matches any single character that is one of the characters
that NEdit recognizes as a word delimiter character, while the `\Y' token
matches any character that is NOT a word delimiter character.  Word delimiter
characters are dynamic in nature, meaning that the user can change them through
preference settings.  For this reason, they must be handled differently by the
regular expression engine.  As a consequence of this, `\y' and `\Y' can not be
used within a character class specification.
