Subject: Announcing NEdit 4.0 -- GUI Unix Text Editor

text editor available for Unix and VMS systems, free or not.
For those who have not heard of NEdit before, it is a GUI style plain-text
editor for X/Motif systems. It is very easy to use, especially for those
familiar with the Macintosh or MS Windows style of interface, combining full
use of the mouse and window manager, with keystroke efficiency and a full
complement of powerful editing commands.

NEdit is available for free, in source and executable form for most popular
Unix and VMS workstations: SGI, DEC (DEC Unix, Ultrix, VMS, AXP), IBM, HP, Sun
(SunOS and Solaris). A supported Linux version will be available in about a
month. Porting to other systems has generally been easy, but you must have
Motif.

The contrib directory for 4.0 is still a blank slate. If you build a version
for an unsupported system type, please consider sending us a copy, or at least
a Makefile, so other users can benefit.

Sources and executables are available via anonymous ftp.fnal.gov in the
/pub/nedit/v4_0 directory. There is also a web page for NEdit at:
http://fnpspa.fnal.gov/nirvana/nedit.html, or find out more about Fermilab:
