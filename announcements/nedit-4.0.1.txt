Subject: ANNOUNCING: NEdit 4.0.1 High Quality GUI Text Editor for Unix

NEdit 4.0.1 is now available. Sources and executables for the new version
can be found on ftp.fnal.gov in the /pub/nedit/v4_0_1 directory.
While NEdit is not all that well known, those who do know about it generally
regard it as the best GUI-style plain-text editor available on Unix or VMS
systems. And it's free!

Version 4.0.1 is a bug fix and compatibility release. For users who still
have 3.x versions, NEdit 4.0 is definitely worth the effort to upgrade. Major
additions include rectangular selection, learn/replay, and client/server
mode. 4.0.1, offers the following improvements over 4.0:

Bug Fixes:

- (Motif 2.0) Vestigial scroll bar shadow in main window
- (Motif 2.0) Typing file names in file dialog lists didn't work
- Paste with middle mouse button after rectangular secondary operations
could incorrectly behave as if rectangular
- Problems displaying VERY long lines
- Undo could improperly remove "(modified)" marker
- Text display could be messed up after certain text replacement operations
(also known as the <nl> problem)
- highlightBackground resource improperly named in nedit.c and app-defaults
- Deleting a rectangular selection in no-tabs mode would remove more text
than just the rectangle

Feature Changes:

- Filling of rectangular selections no longer requires that the filled text
fit within the selection rectangle
- Linux is now an officially supported platform

NEdit, it is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) style plain-text editor for
X/Motif systems. It is very easy to use, especially for those familiar with
the Macintosh or MS Windows style of interface, combining full use of the
mouse and window manager, with keystroke efficiency and a full complement of
powerful editing commands.

NEdit Features:

- Efficient, proven command set
- Very complete functionality. NEdit is the primary editor for
thousands of Unix and VMS programmers
- Thorough consistency with Motif, MS Windows, and Macintosh
conventions
- Designed for intensive use: fast response time, menu and dialog
shortcuts, streamlined interaction
- Multi-level undo
- Learn/replay
- 100% GUI from the ground up
- True multi-window, fully graphical design
- Mouse based editing
- Cut and Paste with other X/Motif programs, full compatibility
with all X and Motif selection and text interchange styles
- Secondary, quick-action, selections
- Rectangular selection mode
- Easy to learn
- Just point and type
- Capabilities are presented clearly in top level menus
- Comprehensive on-line help
- No special knowledge of X required, all important options
can be set from within the program
- Features for programmers
- Auto-indent
- Block indentation adjustment
- Parenthesis flashing and matching
- Find lines directly from compiler error output
- Emulated tabs
- Unix ctags support
- Client/Server mode for integration with software development tools
- Easy installation
- Self contained single executable file
- Pre-built, tested executables available for Silicon Graphics, Sun
(Solaris & SunOS), HP, OSF/1, DEC Ultrix, IBM AIX, Linux, and VMS
systems

NEdit is available for free, in both source and executable form for most
popular Unix and VMS workstations: SGI, DEC (DEC Unix, Ultrix, VMS, AXP), IBM,
HP, Sun (SunOS and Solaris) and Linux. Porting to other systems has generally
been easy, but you must have Motif libraries to build from sources. (execut-
ables for systems for which Motif is optional are statically linked with
Motif).

Sources and executables are available via anonymous ftp.fnal.gov in the
/pub/nedit/v4_0_1 directory. There is also a web page for NEdit at:
