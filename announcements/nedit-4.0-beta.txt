Subject: NEdit 4.0 Beta Release

The Beta Test version of NEdit 4.0 is now available from ftp.fnal.gov in the
/pub/nedit/v4.0_BETA directory. This is a major new revision of the popular
GUI style text editor for Unix and VMS systems.
1) If you take a copy, please don't re-distribute it without making extremely
clear that it is beta-test software. Be sure to replace your copy when the
final version is available.

2) Please take some time to give us your feedback. Report ANY problems, no
matter how trivial. We hope to have the final release ready very soon, by
the end of January if possible, so please get your comments in quickly.

3) Be warned that, while we've been using it safely for the last couple of
months, this is still test software, and NEdit has undergone major internal
changes since the last release.

Send your comments and bug reports to nedit_...@fnal.gov.


New Features

editing operations, including special rectangular modes for shifting
and filling.

with the mouse.
- Learn/Replay -- The ability to record keystrokes and menu choices for
later replay. Learned key sequences can also be saved as macros.

environments, mailers, etc., or to control NEdit sessions from the
shell or command line.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Crash in Font dialog on HP and Linux
- Newly raised windows (from icons or window menu) receive input focus
- Sequences of up and down arrows maintain column tracking beyond
short and blank lines
- Replace in Selection undoes as a unit
- Search result and line number selections are centered better on screen
- Bell volume not overridden
- Crash in shift for tab distance > 8 characters
- Window close box behavior follows MS Windows standard
- Fixed print dialog job name stickiness

- No special font required for control characters
- Secondary operations between windows work properly again
Other Differences
-----------------

Secondary selections are back on the middle mouse button (in 3.0 and 3.1 they
were on the right button). For this release, both right and middle mouse
buttons can be used interchangeably, though in the future, the right button
will be re-claimed again for something like quick menus or pan scrolling.

Support for Motif-style drag and drop is missing from this release (the ability
to grab selections and drag them between windows, the least used of all of the
interchange methods) to meet our release deadline. It will probably be
supported in future releases, particularly if we hear complaints.
