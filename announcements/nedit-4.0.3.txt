Subject: NEdit 4.0.3 High Quality GUI Text Editor

NEdit 4.0.3 is now available from ftp://ftp.fnal.gov/pub/nedit/v4_0_3/.
NEdit is a free Motif-based text editor for Unix and VMS systems. NEdit
combines high reliability, GUI standard behavior, thorough functionality,
and excellent performance, with the best mouse-interactivity of any Unix
text editor. For more information, visit:

http://www-pat.fnal.gov/nirvana/nedit.html

Version 4.0.3 is a minor bug fix release, probably the last before the
major 5.0 release tentatively scheduled for this summer. The users who
will benefit most from this release are those running Linux 2.0 where
NEdit can crash in the Split Window command.

Supported systems are Silicon Graphics, Sun (Solaris & SunOS), HP,
Digital Unix, DEC Ultrix, IBM AIX, Linux, and VMS, with contributed
executables and Makefiles available for many more.


Bugs Fixed in 4.0.3

- Crash in Split Window command (Linux 2.0 systems)

- Crash in Revert to Saved on files which become empty outside of NEdit

- Message: "internal consistency check failed: tl1", and/or trouble
scrolling to the first line of a file, and/or appearance of "<nl>"
character in place of newline near the beginning of the file (rare)

- Sequence, <modify file> -> Save -> Undo -> Save -> Redo, leaves
file marked as unmodified.

- In SGI mode (special Motif appearance features available on Silicon
Graphics workstations), crash when split panes < 1 line high

- Can't do middle mouse paste after selected line in no-auto-wrap mode

- Dragging a single line in rectangular drag mode drags just the first
character of the line

- Regular expressions over 256 characters long fail and report various
errors
